#Data Type Practice with Pokemon!

This repo was the first project I completed attending General Assembly's Data Science Immersive course. It went through different data type manipulation and was a good break in project to fortify some Python skills.

'project-1-starter-code.ipyb' had the base template for the questions and the code written were the answers. I kept this format for readability purposes.
