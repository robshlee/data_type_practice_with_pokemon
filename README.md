# Data Type Practice with Pokemon

This repo was the first project I completed attending General Assembly's Data Science Immersive course. It went through different data type manipulation and was a good break in project to fortify some Python skills.

**'project-1-starter-code.ipyb'** had a template for questions and the code written were my answers to the questions.
